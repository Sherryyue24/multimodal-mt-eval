Quite thick, heavy sugar nose (almost probitas like), but not too sweet. Dreamy daiquiri if you ask me.\n\nAdding to this thread on my #Japanese #Okinawa #Rum exploration\nOpened this OneRum bottle intending to daiquiri, but the fragrance or lack prompted me to pull out and get nosy. Smells a bit like Indian palm toddy. Uses sugar just from Ie island. Tempted to say Clairin like but no it's more spirit, vodka or sochu like - thin, smooth with a touch of heat (48%) just a late hint it's sugar distillate. Sochu, awamori sensibilities in making it for sure. (Mizuho Distillery)\n1/3\n\n2/3\nThis Ie Island #rum is from the Single island series. It was the only one I could get - besides the all island blend bottle, in my too brief ¾ day in #Naha #Okinawa \nHere's their webpage on this rum (translated)\nhttps://onerum-jp.translate.goog/produ...\nOrig: https://onerum.jp/product/ie-island-ru...\nDo look up their about page too.\n\n3/3\nOk so I did make that #Daiquiri  \n2 oz #rum\n1 oz fresh squeezed lime juice [wish I had shikuwasa]\n¾ oz rich simple syrup\nOh dear f$expletive deleted me - in a well chilled coupe, took a sip and this is exquisite.

Why do 7 and 9 have 4 letters, but others 3. Why those two? Why not assign 1 some letters?\nIs 0 always been space?\n\nFirst of all, lemme make things worse, the Nokia 2110 ignores all your alphabets and decides oqz get their own button. But 1 is still empty!\n\nWith SMS use of these keys being first used on this nokia 2110* why do we have these on telephones?\nThank the US! In the 1950s the Bell network replaced operators by automation, “connect me to texas” became 839, eight.. thr… what… \nOkay Bell had an issue numbers! We have 9 numbers we can assign letters to to make routing easier. 26 letters 8 keys.\n0 is a no go, special use. 1… aaand here we go!\n(* officially, nokias history is incorrect don’t correct me)\n\nWhy is even on the iPhone 1 an empty key? Why did USA get +1?\nThe old Bell network had 1 reserved as a shortcut to the long distance network! So if a town started with the letters ABC you’d… yes automatically get onto the long distance network, at a heavy charge. Thus this separation!\n\nSo here we go at Bell again, the English alphabethas 26 letters, we have 8 keys. That is 3 and something per key… \nWhich letters do we drop. We need to drop two!\nZ was the last letter to enter the company thus first to go!\nThe letter after that is Y… now that is a popular letter in place names, new York anyone? We cannot fire a letter with a perfect track record!\n\nLanguage experts were hired to eliminate one more letter from the alphabet.\nQ (sorry Q not personal) is a special letter, every French person knows Q cannot live without U. So either one had to go. \nQ in the English language has less to do than U, and Q was dropped from the Bell exchange name scheme!\nAnd this kids is why you won’t find it on old telephones.\n\nBack to T9.

Only Democrats[.] Public/media relations professional[.] Married and enjoying beach life in the State of Washington[.] Onward to 2026\"\n\nIn every bit of sincerity, if you are planning to travel to the United States in the coming months or years, do NOT travel to the United States. Like at all. \nYou will not be safe here. It is a fascist country and its policy now is to punish people for the crime of fucking nothing.\n\nI cannot personally attest to the bona fides of Jim Grandone, but IF he is what his profile claims he is, and if his blithe dismissal of people's fears for their own safety in a country run by people who declare every day \"YOU SHOULD LIVE IN FEAR\" is shared by ANYone in the Democratic Party, like this is just a \"rough patch\" we're going through but haha that's \"just politics, amirite?\" - and \"normal\" can somehow be reachieved via business-as-usual - this is a person so fucking disengaged with reality as to basically be unemployable.\nThis is not sports. It's life-and-death shit. And everyone not in the U.S. right now should consider the U.S. a motherfucking quarantine zone. That is the safest thing you can possibly do as pertains to the United States of America.\n\nOne thing I will tell you with absolute certainty is that any professional Democrat who still drags out the dead horse \"I still believe in the fundamental goodness of the American people\" is either criminally stupid or painfully deluded and you need to do ANYthing OTHER than shit that person prescribes. That theory underwent its most comprehensive test last fall and turns out it was just a glib fucking bromide that vomited blood and died.\n\nYou can believe in the fundamental goodness of SOME American people, of course, do, have at it, but as to the THE American people being \"good,\" yeah, the data pretty fucking categorically refute that.", "source_length": 1990, "image_path": "/Users/yue/Documents/code/nlpproject/multimodal-mt-eval/data/wmt2025_raw/assets/en/social/114157282362077575-anon/114157282362077575-anon_1.png", "reference_text": null, "meta": {"domain": "social", "dataset_id": "wmttest2025", "collection_id": "general", "prompt_instruction": "You are a professional English-to-Egyptian Arabic translator, tasked with providing translations suitable for use in Egypt (ar_EG).
