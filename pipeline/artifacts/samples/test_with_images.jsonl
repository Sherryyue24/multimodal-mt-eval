It is a fascist country and its policy now is to punish people for the crime of fucking nothing.\n\nI cannot personally attest to the bona fides of Jim Grandone, but IF he is what his profile claims he is, and if his blithe dismissal of people's fears for their own safety in a country run by people who declare every day \"YOU SHOULD LIVE IN FEAR\" is shared by ANYone in the Democratic Party, like this is just a \"rough patch\" we're going through but haha that's \"just politics, amirite?\" - and \"normal\" can somehow be reachieved via business-as-usual - this is a person so fucking disengaged with reality as to basically be unemployable.\nThis is not sports. It's life-and-death shit. And everyone not in the U.S. right now should consider the U.S. a motherfucking quarantine zone. That is the safest thing you can possibly do as pertains to the United States of America.\n\nOne thing I will tell you with absolute certainty is that any professional Democrat who still drags out the dead horse \"I still believe in the fundamental goodness of the American people\" is either criminally stupid or painfully deluded and you need to do ANYthing OTHER than shit that person prescribes. That theory underwent its most comprehensive test last fall and turns out it was just a glib fucking bromide that vomited blood and died.\n\nYou can believe in the fundamental goodness of SOME American people, of course, do, have at it, but as to the THE American people being \"good,\" yeah, the data pretty fucking categorically refute that.", "source_length": 1990, "image_path": "/Users/yue/Documents/code/nlpproject/multimodal-mt-eval/data/wmt2025_raw/assets/en/social/114157282362077575-anon", "reference_text": null, "meta": {"domain": "social", "dataset_id": "wmttest2025", "collection_id": "general", "prompt_instruction": "You are a professional English-to-Egyptian Arabic translator, tasked with providing translations suitable for use in Egypt (ar_EG).

So it goes. It's previously been converted for a wheelchair ramp, which means the floor has been lowered, and this means there's nowhere safe to bolt rear passenger seats, and so can't have that \"rock and roll\" bed, that converts into seatbelted seats for passengers.\nIt does add a large underfloor storage area though.\nI thought it would be fairly easy to remove the metal plates over the windows, but that turned out to be a mistaken assumption too. Was no metal plates. They'd just painted over the glass with some metallic paint. Luckily this can be just scraped off, presumably with some paint dissolving solvents applied too. Dunno. I let the professionals handle that.\n\nThe folks that can do an actually good job of converting it into a microcamper are busy till July, so I get to play at doing a half arsed job to tide it over until then.\nFirst job is taking out the floor to gain access to that underfloor area and to cover that in linoleum. Had some lying around after they did the bathroom last year.\nThen to refit the floor and cover all that in a red felt carpet.\nThe job is shoddy here really. What's needed is to insulate the entire body of the car and then cover professionally and well, but I dunno how to do all that. I just used spray glue to fasten this stretch carpet to the existing wood, that'll be replaced when it's converted proper anyway.\nThe roof will remain cold and metal till then.\n\nThis chair works very well in the van. Should ideally be fastened better to the floor, but it has a nice three mode positions.\nSeating, and chaise-long, and flat as a bed with the passenger seat folded down.\n\nYou can get a folding leaf table, and if you saw off the bottom 15cm or so of the panels forming the sides and front of the table, and also don't bother to attach any of the the back leaf, then it becomes just the right height to mostly fit under the rear window.\nIt's a little higher than the camper-fridge, but the camper fridge is pretty much the same height as a little bedside cabinet.\nThere's also a small rectangular sink that fits nicely around the same width as the fridge alongside that cut down table.\nAnd thus, the interior can be mostly constructed in my flat. The kids in the flat upstairs kept waving as me as I was doing a terrible job of cutting down those panels with a jigsaw in the yard.\n\nThen there's a whole day of carrying those things out to the van and trying to screw them into the floor.\nHad to swap the fridge and the cabinet around from the plan. The fridge is less deep than it is wide and doesn't block the table-leaf when it's at the edge with door facing the front of the car.\nI expected to have to pause here and measure up and buy some wood, but someone had thrown out a desk that matches very well and a bit more sawing managed to get that into the right shape to build a frame to hold everything in place.\nThat sink is attached by only one of the six grips that are supposed to hold it. Two can't be used flat against a wooden board, and 3 aren't against anything at all right now.\nMaybe I can get to attach better when the pump and tap arrive.\n\nI like the easy access to battery and water and things from the back. Fair amount of storage there too which is accessible from inside if the table is up.\nStill need to put the water pump into the water cannister, and power it, and attach some sort of tap to it.\n\nAnd that's about as good a job as I can do really. Hopefully some of it will still be useable in a few months when it's done properly by a professional.\nAt least the fridge ought to carry over.\nThe bed folding down past the passenger seat is great. I'm too talk for this van really, but that makes it workable. Shame the seat/bed has to be so narrow though. The two-seater was very temping and feels like it ought to just about fit but, wouldn't really be any way to unfold it from within the van and the steering wheel gets in the way for folding the driving seat down like the passenger seat does so couldn't really go flat without also lifting up.\n\nThank goodness for Blender!

{"id": "en-ar_EG_#_social_#_114220065940975488", "source_lang": "en", "target_lang": "ar_EG", "source_text": "Game 9 of #UniversityChallenge was a hell of a match. Oriel Oxford (530 students) vs Durham (20,000), and Oriel won, which surprised me after some mistakes they made. The captain didn't know Wittengstein's name!? Possibly just nerves. Durham was ahead, then it was tied at 170, then they dropped to 165. A pity. I was rooting for them. Great team, with all four strong, so I hope they make the cut.\n\nGame 10 of #UniversityChallenge had a great performance by Christ's Cambridge, who have a consultative captain, a good team, and a strong member named Bethlehem, so Roger Tilling called out \"Christ's Bethlehem!\" Exeter Oxford never got hold of much, and are out of the running. I could see Christ's Cambridge quietly going far in this series. \nSome nice math questions, a picture round connected to food, and a tricky flag question. Good game.\n\nGame 11 of #UniversityChallenge was St Andrews (granted university status by an antipope!) vs Cardiff. First round is nearing its end. Some good questions, including mentions of roll-on roll-of ferries, Agnes Martin, and Stax Records. Cardiff Tarsala will never forget her Booker T bloomer, I'm afraid. Nice quizzing from both teams, though it only really got cracking in the last few minutes.\n\nGame 12 of #UniversityChallenge was Leeds vs Edinburgh. Leeds took a long time to get going, then had a surge in the middle but couldn't keep it going. Seemed like a number of film questions this time, and I was glad to hear PEI as an answer; no flags, though it seems like they crop up every time. Edinburgh Myles is a good captain and the whole team is strong and works well together. I think they'll do well.\n\n#UniversityChallenge game 13 was a curious one, with Leicester being jokey, wasting time and never getting going, while the LSE captain would often turn to the farthest player for an answer, which was not infrequently wrong. Still, LSE cleaned up. I liked the blues bonus round, though sadly Leicester got none. Canadian mentions: WL Mackenzie King and Margaret Atwood. The best part was Roger Tilling saying \"Leicester Lister!\"\n\nGame 14 of #UniversityChallenge was top-notch stuff, solid quizzing, down to business, fast answers, good knowledge, close ending. It seems we'll see both SOAS London and St. Edmund Hall Oxford again, because the loser makes the repechage. Very close at the finish, down to \"Naples\" and \"pollen.\" An unassumingly great game.\n\nGame 15 of #UniversityChallenge is the first of two in the repechage, where the four highest-scoring losing teams try to make it through. This week was UCL and St. Andrews, in a good-natured cheery match. Very strong play from UCL, who have a solid team, and UCL Mandel was in top form. Good questions, some tough, such as requiring \"panthera\" specifically or knowing \"day\" in Russian.\n\nJust got to game 16 of #UniversityChallenge today, a week late, and it was a nail-biter! Really fast work at the end, with Durham coming from behind in the last few minutes to catch SOAS London in a tie in the final seconds. It went to a starter question that I got on the first clue (being an SF reader I knew \"slipstream\") but neither team knew. Second question and SOAS London Lambert guessed alpaca but it was llama, so Durham won. Phew, what a finish. 😰\n\nGame 17 of #UniversityChallenge is the first of eight knockout games in the second round. This was UCL and LSE, and UCL gave an outstanding performance: very fast buzzing, good teamwork, wide general knowledge from them all (UCL Mandel notable again); they took off at the start and never slowed. Very impressive.\n\nGame 18 of #UniversityChallenge was Durham vs Open University. I was rooting for Durham, who have a great team, but in the end to my surprise Open took it, after a number of rather slow answers. I was glad Durham got Marcel Duchamp right on one question; too bad no one knew Yoko Ono as a Fluxus artist. Much respect for Durham Nash, especially on bird silhouettes and flags.\n\nGame 19 of #UniversityChallenge was Exeter vs Bristol. Bristol got going at the start and never looked back, rolling with momentum, finishing with an incredible score. Exeter only clawed their way back to 0 after 17 minutes. \nI liked the question on common terms in Chinese place names, such as 北 (běi) in Beijing etc. Good geographic knowledge shown.\n\n#UniversityChallenge is back from the Christmas alumni series, and game 20 was liked greased lightening in comparison. Darwin Cambridge Whitaker tore into questions like a monster, but everyone was in good form on that team and also on Edinburgh. Momentum changed through the game. Good quizzing. Three more games in round two, then the long quarter-finals.\n\nIt's quite a change to go from the Christmas series of #UniversityChallenge, where four people didn't know the name of the narrator of Moby-Dick even when told his name is in the first sentence of the book, to the regular round, where they're racing to buzz on questions like \"Fifty-three British thermal units is to grouse hunting as Sydney, Australia, is to what famous star of the London stage?\"\n\nGame 21 of #UniversityChallenge was Wadham Oxford vs Imperial. What a game! Astounding performance from Imperial. \nHowever, being King Crimson fan, I was disappointed that no one recognized them from the opening of \"21st Century Schizoid Man,\" and dismayed when someone thought \"I Zimbra\" by Talking Heads (with Fripp on guitar) was by the Bee Gees. Can't have it all. I remain incredibly impressed.\n\nGame 22 of #UniversityChallenge was Christ's Cambridge vs St Edmund Hall Oxford, two small colleges, but that's how the rules are set up.  Nice picture round with the Dunning-Kruger effect, Asch conformity experiments, and bouba-kiki effect.  Another on mushrooms, which seemed tough to me; identifying them by eye is not easy. Solid game, good playing all around.\n\n#UniversityChallenge game 23 was Cardiff against Queen's Belfast. Ended with a lower score than I felt it would get, maybe due to missed bonuses, but the starters were buzzed fast. Nice flag knowledge, and a good picture round identifying physical laws by diagrams of experiments. A bit too much bantz for my taste, but a solid game.
